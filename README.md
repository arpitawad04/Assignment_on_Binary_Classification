# Assignment_on_Binary_Classification

Objective:
Binary Classification on the Dataset provided and perform Exploratory Data Analysis,do Feature Selection and preprocessing before trainging a model to classify as either '0; or '1'.

Exploratory Data analysis
Finding the correlated variables
Removing Multi Collinearity from the variables.

Extracting important features impacting Target variable
Creating Model to predict target variable on Traing ,Validation and Test data.
Comapring All models outcomes in term of Confusion Matrix and classification report
